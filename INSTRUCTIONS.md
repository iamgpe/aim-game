# Time to improve your aim 🎯 !

Build a web page with Vuejs (and any other library), the user sees 5 circles appearing randomly on the screen. The rules are quite simple :

- The player has 10 seconds at the first round to click on all the circles
- A score board is displayed at the bottom of the page
- Each circle clicked reward 1 point to the player 🏆
- At the next round :
  - the time and the size of circles will be reduced by 25%
  - the scoreboard will remain until the player loses
  - if the player loses, reset the game

__Bonus :__
The circles shrink to nothingness during the round

Have fun 😃 !
